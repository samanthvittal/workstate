# Raw Idea: Time Tracking (TT001-TT014)

Time Tracking (TT001-TT014) - Real-time timer with start/stop functionality, manual time entry with start/end times or duration-only mode, running timer display in header across all views, timer description and project/task linking, discard timer capability, and complete time entry CRUD with list view and filters. Foundation for productivity tracking and reporting.
