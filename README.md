# Workstate
**Where tasks meet time**

Workstate is a self-hosted, open-source application that combines task management and time tracking into a single, coherent workflow.  
It treats *tasks* and *time* as first-class citizens, helping you understand not just what you work on—but how long it actually takes.

---

## ✨ Philosophy

Most productivity tools focus either on *what* you do or *how long* you do it.  
Workstate is built on the idea that these two are inseparable.

- Tasks represent **intent**
- Time represents **reality**
- Insight comes from connecting the two

Workstate is designed to be:
- **Self-hosted first**
- **Privacy-respecting**
- **Minimal, but extensible**
- **Friendly to developers and non-developers alike**

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Unified task and time tracking
- Clear, explicit data model (no magic automation)
- Self-hosted by default
- Works well for individuals and small teams
- Open source and permissively licensed
- Easy to extend via APIs and integrations

---

## 🚫 Non-Goals

To keep the project focused and sustainable, Workstate intentionally does **not** aim to:

- Be a clone of any existing proprietary product
- Replicate proprietary UX, workflows, or APIs
- Offer built-in SaaS hosting (at least initially)
- Track users, collect analytics, or monetize data
- Compete on marketing-driven feature bloat
- Reimplementing proprietary features based on reverse engineering

Workstate values **clarity over cleverness** and **control over convenience**.

## 🏗️ Project Status

🚧 Early development

The initial focus is on:
- Core domain models (tasks, states, time sessions)
- A clean and well-documented API
- A solid foundation for future web and mobile clients

Details will evolve as development progresses.
